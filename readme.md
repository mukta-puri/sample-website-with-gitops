## About
Sample created using [uikit](https://getuikit.com/). Uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for package management and build/debug scripts, [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) for html includes and live reload and GitHub actions to publish the site.

## Running the site for debugging
Call on terminal in the root directory: `npm start`

Does the followig:
- Builds the site into the `dist` folder
- Serves the website on `localhost:3000`
- Opens a browser on `localhose:3000`
- Enables livereload so any changes in the `src` folder are automatically build and the website is refreshed
